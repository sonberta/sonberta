## Hello there, welcome to my profile! :)

My name is Davide and I’m currently an undergraduate student at the University of Milan :it:

- 🧬 **Biotechnology CdL Triennale**  
  *Curriculum in Molecular Biology & Bioinformatics*
- 🧪 Former Biotechnology student at University of Ottawa 🇨🇦
  *BSc in Biochemistry & Chemical Engineering – French Immersion*
- 🌍 International academic background — studied in Italy and Canada  
- 🗣️ Fluent in **Italian, English, and French**

---

## 🎯 My goal
While I continue my academic studies and work on personal projects, I’m building the skills needed to develop applications of **data science and machine learning to biosciences**, hoping to make a meaningful contribution to the scientific community.

🛠️ *This space will keep evolving as I learn more and start building projects worth sharing.*

### 💻 From Biosciences to Data Science 🔬
I’m currently focusing on **integrating data science and machine learning into biosciences**, with the goal of:

- analyzing complex biological datasets  
- extracting meaningful patterns from scientific data  
- contributing reproducible, open research tools  

I’m especially interested in applications of ML to:
- bioinformatics & omics data  
- molecular biology & applied biochemistry  
- biological systems modeling
